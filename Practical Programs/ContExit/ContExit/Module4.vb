    'The return statement returns the program control to the code that called a function sub get,set or operator procedure. 
    'For ex: If a function contains a return statement to return an expression, the return statement terminates execution 
    'of the function and returns the value of the expression to the code which calls the that particular function

    'The return statement without an expression is equivalent to an exit sub or exit property statement within a sub or set procedure.
    'This means that we do not need to provide the expression that is to be returned.

    'the same as the datatype of the procedure.
